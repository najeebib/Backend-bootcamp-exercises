# Image Reversal Project

The Image Reversal Project is a Python program that reverses the colors of an image. It provides two methods for reversing images: single-threaded and multi-process. This project demonstrates the performance difference between these two approaches.

## Modules

### `__main__.py`

Contains the main entry point of the program, where both single-threaded and multi-process methods are called.

### `single_process.py`

Contains the implementation of the single-threaded image reversal method.

### `multi_process.py`

Contains the implementation of the multi-process image reversal method.

## Usage

To use this project, run the `__main__.py` file. This will reverse the colors of the specified image using both single-threaded and multi-process methods.
